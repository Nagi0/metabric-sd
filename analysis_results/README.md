# Processing Results from CN2-SD, Esmam-DS, SSDP+ Algorithms

This guide provides steps to process the results generated by the CN2-SD, Esmam-DS, or SSDP+ algorithms and format the top 2 subgroups of P and N according to the desired pattern.

## Steps to Process the Results

1. **Run the Algorithm:**
- Execute the CN2-SD, Esmam-DS, or SSDP+ algorithm to generate the discovered subgroups. The results should be in a file similar to the example below:

    ```
    DISCOVERED SUBGROUPS

    R0: (KIF20A={'≥ -0.408850'}) & (RBBP8={'< -0.654350'}) [size=370/1904]
    [SM] R1: (PBX1={'≥ 0.6472'}) & (RAB8B={'< 0.21565'}) [size=334/1904; jaccard-c=0.19; jaccard-d=0.00]
    ...
    ```

2. **Read the Results File:**
Load the results file generated by the algorithm.

3. **Filter and Clean the Subgroups:**
- Extract the top 2 subgroups of P (positives) and N (negatives).
- Remove unwanted characters such as `(`, `)`, `{}`, `[]`, and other unnecessary information.

4. **Format the Subgroups:**
- Format the subgroups to match the desired pattern. Example:

  ```
  KLRC1=< 0.0801, CPT1A=≥ 0.0408, RAD54L=≥ -0.841550
  KCTD15=≥ 0.60905, HOXA2=< -0.049150
  ```

5. **Save the Formatted Subgroups:**
Save the formatted subgroups in a file named `esmam-sd_top_p_and_top_n.txt` in the appropriate algorithm's results folder, following the example of `esmam-sd_results`.
